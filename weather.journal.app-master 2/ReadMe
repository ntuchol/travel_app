                                         # Weather Journal App 

- I set up a project environment installing Node and Express.  
+ I got the Weather API from OpenWeatherMap website. 
+ And I tried to get the output of Date, and temperture, and user's response on the website by pushing the generate button.  
+ And I declared projectData  to act as a endpoint(storage). 
+ Then, I made an asynchronous function to fetchg the data from the app endpoint.
